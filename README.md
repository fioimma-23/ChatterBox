	Database Creation:
 Established tables using SQL Server to manage and store all the required databases effectively. Several tables are created –
•	User Table

	API Implementation:
 Implemented APIs using Swagger, ensuring a standardized and documented approach for API development. Lot of Get and Post method are created and displayed.
	API Hosting:
 Hosted the APIs using Internet Information Service Management, ensuring accessibility and availability.

	API Testing:
Conducted API testing using Postman to validate functionality, identify bugs, and ensure reliability.
	API Integration:
Integrated the APIs into the Flutter application for security, error handling, data retrieval, and presentation purposes, creating a seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end systems.
•	WebSockets Integration:
Implemented WebSockets to establish a two-way communication channel between the server and the Flutter application, enabling real-time data exchange. This facilitates instant messaging and updates within the application, enhancing user engagement. Used C# for websocket and integrated with flutter.
